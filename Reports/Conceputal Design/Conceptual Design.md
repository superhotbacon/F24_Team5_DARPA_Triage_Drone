## Introduction

The following conceptual design wll lay out the general solution to the DARPA triage drone challenge [1].

## Restating the Fully Formulated Problem

The fully formulated problem is the overall objective and scope complete with the set of shall statements. This was part of the project proposal. However, it may be that the scope has changed. So, state the fully formulated problem in the introduction of the conceptual design and planning document. For each of the constraints, explain the origin of the constraint (customer specification, standards, ethical concern, broader implication concern, etc).


## Comparative Analysis of Potential Solutions

In this section, various potential solutions are hypothesized, design considerations are discussed, and factors influencing the selection of a solution are outlined. The chosen solution is then identified with justifications for its selection.


## High-Level Solution

This section presents a comprehensive, high-level solution aimed at efficiently fulfilling all specified requirements and constraints. The solution is designed to maximize stakeholder goal attainment, adhere to established constraints, minimize risks, and optimize resource utilization. Please elaborate on how your design accomplishes these objectives.


### Hardware Block Diagram

Block diagrams are an excellent way to provide an overarching understanding of a system and the relationships among its individual components. Generally, block diagrams draw from visual modeling languages like the Universal Modeling Language (UML). Each block represents a subsystem, and each connection indicates a relationship between the connected blocks. Typically, the relationship in a system diagram denotes an input-output interaction.

In the block diagram, each subsystem should be depicted by a single block. For each block, there should be a brief explanation of its functional expectations and associated constraints. Similarly, each connection should have a concise description of the relationship it represents, including the nature of the connection (such as power, analog signal, serial communication, or wireless communication) and any relevant constraints.

The end result should present a comprehensive view of a well-defined system, delegating all atomic responsibilities necessary to accomplish the project scope to their respective subsystems.


### Operational Flow Chart

Similar to a block diagram, the flow chart aims to specify the system, but from the user's point of view rather than illustrating the arrangement of each subsystem. It outlines the steps a user needs to perform to use the device and the screens/interfaces they will encounter. A diagram should be drawn to represent this process. Each step should be represented in the diagram to visually depict the sequence of actions and corresponding screens/interfaces the user will encounter while using the device.


## Atomic Subsystem Specifications

Based on the high-level design, provide a comprehensive description of the functions each subsection will perform.

Inclued a description the interfaces between this subsystem and other subsystems:
- Give the type of signal (e.g. power, analog signal, serial communication, wireless communication, etc).
- Clearly define the direction of the signal (input or output).
- Document the communication protocols used.
- Specifying what data will be sent and what will be received.

Detail the operation of the subsystem:
- Illustrate the expected user interface, if applicable.
- Include functional flowcharts that capture the major sequential steps needed to achieve the desired functionalities.

For all subsystems, formulate detailed "shall" statements. Ensure these statements are comprehensive enough so that an engineer who is unfamiliar with your project can design the subsystem based on your specifications. Assume the role of the customer in this context to provide clear and precise requirements.


## Ethical, Professional, and Standards Considerations

In the project proposal, each team must evaluate the broader impacts of the project on culture, society, the environment, public health, public safety, and the economy. Additionally, teams must consider relevant standards organizations that will inform the design process. A comprehensive discussion should be included on how these considerations have influenced the design. This includes detailing constraints, specifications, and practices implemented as a result, and how these address the identified considerations.


## Resources

You have already estimated the resources needed to complete the solution. Now, let's refine those estimates.

### Budget

Develop a budget proposal with justifications for expenses associated with each subsystem. Note that the total of this budget proposal can also serve as a specification for each subsystem. After creating the budgets for individual subsystems, merge them to create a comprehensive budget for the entire solution.

### Skills

First, conduct a thorough analysis of the skills currently available within the team, and then compare these skills to the specific requirements of each subsystem. Based on this analysis, assign each team member to oversee the development of a particular subsystem. Additionally, appoint a different team member to take the specifications and generate a corresponding solution. Ensure that the assignments are structured in such a way that no single team member is simultaneously managing and being managed by the same person. If there are more team members than subsystems, consider further subdividing the solutions into smaller tasks or components, thereby allowing each team member the opportunity to manage and design a subsystem.

### Timeline

Revise the detailed timeline (Gantt chart) you created in the project proposal. Ensure that the timeline is optimized for detailed design. Address critical unknowns early and determine if a prototype needs to be constructed before the final build to validate a subsystem. Additionally, if subsystem $A$ imposes constraints on subsystem $B$, generally, subsystem $A$ should be designed first.

## Statement of Contributions

Each team member is required to make a meaningful contribution to the project proposal. Ensure that each member's contributions are clearly documented.
