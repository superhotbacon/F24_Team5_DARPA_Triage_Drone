## **Introduction**

&nbsp; Over the last ten years, drones have become ubiquitous in many ways. From warfare to marketing, drones have become cheaper alternatives to old problems and new solutions for emerging issues. In the effort to help first responders, drones can be used in many ways to help fight fires, locate lost persons, identify hazardous materials, and more.

&nbsp; In search and rescue missions, our drone could provide initial canvasing of an area to pinpoint locations of possible human sightings that could be followed up via helicopter or ground search team. Furthermore. our drone could help scan buildings to find the hottest part of the fire. This proposal will set out to outline a project that will build a drone to suit these objectives. In the coming sections, the specific goals and objectives will be laid out as well as specifications and constraints that our team will strive to overcome. Our team will also examine current solutions to this problem and other approaches and argue why our project is more effective.

## **Formulating the problem**

&nbsp; To build this drone, we must consider the scope of our project and the specific constraints we will be working with. One of the main problems we will encounter is the connectivity of the drone to the centralized position. This is necessary as the drones themselves will not have the processing power to make a full identification of a lost person. Rather, it would send back data of a possible sighting to be sifted through by the Fire Department. The drone would need to be able to track its location via GPS in order to not get lost as well as searching a target area. A large obstacle to be tackled is locating individuals through the tree canopy. Thermal imaging itself does not penetrate the tree canopy well. So more sophisticated approaches must be implemented. 

&nbsp;In addition to autonomous capabilities, the drone will be able to be manually controlled. This will provide more functionality to the drone. As we add equipment to the drone, it becomes heavier so our team will need to take care to get the lightest equipment possible while also reigning in our budget. Take will also have to be taken in order to safely charge the drone. Over charging Lithium Polymer batteries can be very dangerous. This is especially of concern as Li-Po batteries are a popular choice for drones.

## **SPECIFICATION**

**Surveillance area:**

The drone shall have a range of 5 miles on flat land.

Measure of success: Take drone top open piece of land and set up a perimeter 5 miles away. Ensure the drone can make it to the other side of the target area.

**Max Height of drone:**

The drone shall be able to reach a height of 200 feet. The drone shall be expected to fly over buildings and trees without losing connection.

Measures of success: Use barometric readings on the drone to verify the drone can reach a height of 200 feet. To test the connectivity. Fly the drone around an area with buildings to ensure it does not lose connection. Possibly in downtown Cookeville.

**Drone weight:**

The drone shall weigh less than 20 lbs to ensure ease of transport. The done weight shall not restrict the agility of the drone. It shall be maneuverable and pilot-able by most individuals with minimal training.  

Measures of Success: Weigh the drone on a scale. Set up a test with members of the fire department to ensure they can pilot the drone without much training.

**Battery Life and batteries:**

The drone shall be able to fly for at least 30 minutes during normal operation of any mode. The drone shall be able to stay charging on the dock until needed for use without becoming overcharged or being a hazard.

Measures of success: run tests during each mode of operation to ensure it meats specification. Run tests or provide documentation showing why the drone is safe to be left charging on the dock.

**Zoom specifications**

The drone shall be able to read the side of a rail car at a distance of at lest 50 feet. The drone shall be able to clearly read the markings on a barrel at a range of at least 20 feet. 

Measures of success: conduct tests with standard font sizes of a barrel and rail car to determine readability. Conduct tests with some reference of measurement, such as a football field.

**Ambient temperature readings**

The drone shall be able to sense the ambient temperature and display it on screen and alert users when the temperature is too high. If the drone is in an autonomous mode, it will use the temperature readings to ensure its own safety.

Measures of success: Conduct tests to ensure the temperature reading is accurate and precise on screen. Run decoy tests with a lower temperature threshold than documented as dangerous to ensure the drone will take precautions to avoid the decoy temperature. Provide documentation showing the highest temperature the drone can go and provide a margin of error so that accidents do not occur.

**Ambient Chemical readings**

The drone shall be able to detect LEL (lower explosive level) percentages for common organic compounds found in fires. The drone shall be able to detect and display oxygen, carbon dioxide, and Hydrogen Sulfide levels.

Measures of success: Provide documentation that displayed levels are accurate.

**GPS location**

The drone shall be able to take in GPS coordinates and fly to specified locations to carry out certain tasks. The drone shall also be able to track its own GPS location and relay this information back to the controller.

Measures of success: program the drone to fly out to specified areas and ensure it arrives to said areas.

**Video recording and live feed**

The drone shall be able to transmit its feed directly to the fire department and upload its video after landing back at the dock

Measures of success: Ensure the drone can properly store data and be usable after landing. Make sure the live feed of the drone is watchable up to the full range of the drone.

## **Relevant Literature**

The IEEE website has multiple papers on this very topic, but the following specifically details the process of an unmanned vehicle being used for search and rescue (<https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10434325>).

There are essentially 4 basic steps in the process:

- Receive sensor inputs
- Process the inputs
- Make a decision
- Actuate the mechanisms

How each is accomplished is decided by the engineering team.

### **Contemporary Specs**

The following are the range of certain drone specifications that we deem relevant to the project according to this website's ranking of the top SAR drones of 2023 (<https://www.dslrpros.com/dslrpros-blog/the-top-12-search-and-rescue-drones-of-2023-review/>).

#### Cost

- Min - $5,000
- Max - $13,000

#### Flight Time

- Min – 30 min
- Max – 65 min

#### Transmission Range

- Min – 7.5 miles
- Max – 12.4 miles

#### Weight

- Min – 1.06 lb
- Max – 4.72 lb

#### Other Properties

- Weather resistant (wind and rain resistance)
- Night vision capabilities

If our project is to be a success, our drone will need to excel at one of the previously mentioned areas and not fall too far below the others. More relevant specifications may be identified.

## **Impacts of a search and rescue drone (8)**

1) **Culture**

\- The development of drones in the use of search and rescue contributes to positive outlooks on technological advancement. Using drone technology to solve real-world problems by way of technology creates a culture of high-tech innovation.

2) **Society**

\- Aviation drones can be faster, and safer than the boots-on-the-ground method of search and rescue. A drone can assess the severity of victims and create a priorty list for first responders to save more lives. Along with increasing the sense of safety in communities it also unlocks new roles and responsibilities under an emergency services career.

3) **Environment**

\- Ground-based search and rescue operations can be disruptive to the natural environment. Aerial search and rescue operations by way of drones are less invasive and leave a smaller environmental footprint.

4) **Public Safety**

\- Search and Rescue drones allow for faster response times from rescue professionals as well as faster aid brought to the victims in a post emergency situation. These factors contribute to a higher chance of a successful rescue.

5) **Economy**

\- Traditional search and rescue methods require expensive resources such as manpower, equipment, and fuel. On the other hand, search and rescue drones can allow for more cost-effective rescue plans.

\- The application of search and rescue drones can grow the drone and technological development industry. This would result in job opportunities and economic stimulation.
