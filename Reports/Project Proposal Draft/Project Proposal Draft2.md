## **Introduction**

&nbsp; Over the last ten years, drones have become ubiquitous in many ways. From warfare to marketing, drones have become cheaper alternatives to old problems and new solutions for emerging issues. In the effort to help first responders, drones can be used in many ways to help fight fires, locate lost persons, identify hazardous materials, and more.

&nbsp; In search and rescue missions, our drone could provide initial canvasing of an area to pinpoint locations of possible human sightings that could be followed up via helicopter or ground search team. Furthermore, our drone could help scan buildings to find the hottest part of the fire. This proposal will set out to outline a project that will build a drone to suit these objectives. In the coming sections, the specific goals and objectives will be laid out as well as specifications and constraints that our team will strive to overcome. Our team will also examine current solutions to this problem and other approaches and argue why our project is more effective.

## **Formulating the problem**

&nbsp; To build this drone, we must consider the scope of our project and the specific constraints we will be working with. One of the main problems we will encounter is the connectivity of the drone to the centralized position. This is necessary as the drones themselves will not have the processing power to make a full identification of a lost person. Rather, it would send back data of a possible sighting to be sifted through by the Fire Department. The drone would need to be able to track its location via GPS in order to not get lost as well as searching a target area. A large obstacle to be tackled is locating individuals through the tree canopy. Thermal imaging itself does not penetrate the tree canopy well. So more sophisticated approaches must be implemented. 

&nbsp;In addition to autonomous capabilities, the drone will be able to be manually controlled. This will provide more functionality to the drone. As we add equipment to the drone, it becomes heavier so our team will need to take care to get the lightest equipment possible while also reigning in our budget. Take will also have to be taken in order to safely charge the drone. Over charging Lithium Polymer batteries can be very dangerous. This is especially of concern as Li-Po batteries are a popular choice for drones.

## **SPECIFICATION**

**Surveillance area:**

The drone shall have a range of 5 miles on flat land.

Measure of success: Take drone top open piece of land and set up a perimeter 5 miles away. Ensure the drone can make it to the other side of the target area.

**Max Height of drone:**

The drone shall be able to reach a height of 200 feet. The drone shall be expected to fly over buildings and trees without losing connection.

Measures of success: Use barometric readings on the drone to verify the drone can reach a height of 200 feet. To test the connectivity. Fly the drone around an area with buildings to ensure it does not lose connection. Possibly in downtown Cookeville.

**Drone weight:**

The drone shall weigh less than 20 lbs to ensure ease of transport. The done weight shall not restrict the agility of the drone. It shall be maneuverable and pilot-able by most individuals with minimal training.  

Measures of Success: Weigh the drone on a scale. Set up a test with members of the fire department to ensure they can pilot the drone without much training.

**Battery Life:**

Batter weight:

1. Small 100- 300 g
2. Medium 300-600 g
3. Large 1-4 kg

Depends on the customer and area being surveillance.

**Desired Climate:**

Weather:

- Clear Skys
- Cloudy
- Overcast
- Snow on the ground
- Nighttime

Anything that does not have to deal with precipitation.

**Processing power:**

This drone will have to process images, video, collision algorithms, and programs while searching.

**Max data storage:**

Storage inputs:

1\. 4K Video Recording: 20-25 GB per hour

2\. 1080p Video Recording: 6-10 GB per hour

3\. Thermal Video: 1-2 GB per hour

4\. Telemetry Data: <1 MB per hour

Considering this, we believe we will need a 256 GB Flash Drive/ SD Card. They are very light but if we need to, we might get away with less storage. Cost: 40$

**Picture Resolution of camera:**

Resolution:

1. 4k (Best Option)
2. 1080p

Zoom:

1. Optical zoom (Best Option)
2. Digital zoom

Cost Depending.

**Camera Options:**

Cameras:

1. FLIR Vue Pro R (Thermal Camera) cost: 2,500 $ supposably the most affordable
2. DJI Zenmuse XT2 (Thermal + Visual) cost: 2,900$
3. RunCam Split 4: 200$
4. DJI Zenmuse Z3 cost: 500$ Best Option for non-thermal

Bulk of our cost will be coming from the camera. For a camera with 4k or 10080p it is recommended a max height of 200ft-400ft off the ground to keep good detail in the camera.

**\*The spec option list is kept broad as a budget has not been given**

## **Relevant Literature**

The IEEE website has multiple papers on this very topic, but the following specifically details the process of an unmanned vehicle being used for search and rescue (<https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10434325>).

There are essentially 4 basic steps in the process:

- Receive sensor inputs
- Process the inputs
- Make a decision
- Actuate the mechanisms

How each is accomplished is decided by the engineering team.

### **Contemporary Specs**

The following are the range of certain drone specifications that we deem relevant to the project according to this website's ranking of the top SAR drones of 2023 (<https://www.dslrpros.com/dslrpros-blog/the-top-12-search-and-rescue-drones-of-2023-review/>).

#### Cost

- Min - $5,000
- Max - $13,000

#### Flight Time

- Min – 30 min
- Max – 65 min

#### Transmission Range

- Min – 7.5 miles
- Max – 12.4 miles

#### Weight

- Min – 1.06 lb
- Max – 4.72 lb

#### Other Properties

- Weather resistant (wind and rain resistance)
- Night vision capabilities

If our project is to be a success, our drone will need to excel at one of the previously mentioned areas and not fall too far below the others. More relevant specifications may be identified.

## **Impacts of a search and rescue drone**

1) **Culture**

\- The development of drones in the use of search and rescue contributes to positive outlooks on technological advancement. Using drone technology to solve real-world problems by way of technology creates a culture of high-tech innovation.

2) **Society**

\- Aviation drones can be faster, and safer than the boots-on-the-ground method of search and rescue. A drone can access terrain that might be dangerous for humans to traverse, potentially saving lives. Along with increasing the sense of safety in communities it also unlocks new roles and responsibilities under an emergency services career.

3) **Environment**

\- Ground-based search and rescue operations can be disruptive to the natural environment. Aerial search and rescue operations by way of drones are less invasive and leave a smaller environmental footprint.

4) **Public Safety**

\- Search and Rescue drones allow for quick intervention and less risk to both the victim and rescue professionals. These factors contribute to a higher chance of a successful rescue.

5) **Economy**

\- Traditional search and rescue methods require expensive resources such as manpower, equipment, and fuel. On the other hand, search and rescue drones can allow for more cost-effective rescue plans.

\- The application of search and rescue drones can grow the drone and technological development industry. This would result in job opportunities and economic stimulation.
