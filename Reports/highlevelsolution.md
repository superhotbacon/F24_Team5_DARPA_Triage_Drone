## High-Level Solution

The solution to this problem rerquires an aviation drone as well as integrated sensors to record data. The drone will be manually flown to the victim and have the ability to hover 1 meter above the target. Attached to the drone will be a sensing system that can measure one's, heart rate and respiratory rate, and cognitiveness all without contacting the individual. The data gathered by the sensors will then be sent to the computing system. The information will be processed and the person will be catagorized by servereness of injuries in accordance with the START method. 

In order to do this, the design will be split up into subsystems:

1). Power subsystem <br />
    -A battery will be used to supply all necessary power to each device along with voltage regulators to adjust the voltage to the required amount for each sensing device. 
2). Computing subsystem 
    -This subsystem will process the data recieved from the voice detection algorithm as well as the data from the heartbeat and respiratory sensors. The information will then be compared to the START triage method and the results will be wirelessly tranmitted to the user interface. 
3). User Interface Subsystem 
    -This subsystem will display the victims vitals as well as triage level back to the user. The data will be wirelessly transmitted from the computing system back to the control point of the drone. 
4). Voice Detection Subsystem
    -The user will have a button to allow a procedure to occur using a speaker and a microphone.The speaker will send out a call a prompt and and the microphon will capture audio data and relay it back to the computing system. 
5). Heartbeat/Respiratory Subsystem 
    -These sensors are responsible for obtaining heatbeat and respiratory rate frequencies. The data acquired by these sensors will also be sent to the computing system. 


This section presents a comprehensive, high-level solution aimed at efficiently fulfilling all specified requirements and constraints. The solution is designed to maximize stakeholder goal attainment, adhere to established constraints, minimize risks, and optimize resource utilization. Please elaborate on how your design accomplishes these objectives.
