**As today’s technologies dives deeper into the possibilities of drones its applications broaden in its uses  
**for searching for first responders. Drones gives many advantages when in a severe disastrous zone such 
**as floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, ect… These drones are able fly over rivers, trees, and more 
**surveillance a greater area than what a person could. This would allow first responders be able to search 
**a greater area for disasters victims and to be able to monitor victims health state(hear beat and 
**breathing). Because of the importance of this concept DARPA has issued a challenge called the DARPA 
**Triage Challenge, or the DTC. The purpose of the DTC is to provide another way to assist medical 
**responders in evaluating the condition of victims of a disaster quickly and efficiently utilizing uncrewed
**aircraft vehicles, or drones. Combining drones with a range of sensors and applying AI algorithms could 
**together achieve an accurate and precise evaluation of the current situation in a disaster zone. The team 
**will take in consideration all these challenges in their proposed solution to limit their effect and will 
**propose some mitigation for the risks these challenges can pose. The drone proposed to be purchased is 
**manufactured in the US and is used by many government entities. Also, it has an integrated system for 
**security.
