# Relevant Literature

We will have to do some research into the following fields of study to build a successful search and rescue (SAR) drone:
- Vitals detecting via radar
- Image processing
- Drone programming

### Radar
The National Library of Medicine has already done research into reading a subject's vitals at a distance. From their research, it's clear that we'll need to consider the following as we engineer our product:
- How to fine tune our signal to avoid noise generated by the drone or any other external movement.
- How to differentiate between a heart rate and a breathing rate.
- How to consume minimal power with acceptable performance.

### Image Processing
NVIDIA has an article on using the chip our drone will be working with, a jetson nano, for search and rescue purposes. From the text, several steps in the image computing process include:
- Prioritizing speed over detail when observing the landscape.
- Cropping images with likely targets to optimize processing.
- Using an algorithm to train the data.

### Drone Programming
Since our drone will spend the majority of its time searching, it's important to consider portential strategies for navigating any potential terrain. The IEEE explains some important considerations regarding this:
- SAR drones are built to be safe and reliable, following UN regulations.
- SAR drones should avoid disrupting the flow of traffic or any other service.
- SAR drones can optimize their routes to better their performance.
