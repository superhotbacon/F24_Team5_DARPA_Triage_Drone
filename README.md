# F24_Team5_DARPA_Triage_Drone 


## Executive Summary

We are the Fall 2024 Triage Drone capstone team at Tennessee Technological University. We are tackling the [DARPA Triage Challenge](https://triagechallenge.darpa.mil/) and continuing the work of [the Fall 2023 team](https://github.com/TnTech-ECE/Fall2023-DARPA-Drone-Triage-Sensing-System). Our task is to create a drone that can be used in emergency situations to better allocate resources of first responders. This will help save lives by giving first responders a better assessment of a scene so they can get to treating victims faster. The drone will do this by reading the heart rates, breathing rates, and consciousness levels of victims. This project will be easy to use and extremely versatile.
