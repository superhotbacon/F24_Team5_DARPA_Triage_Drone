    Gabe - Set up the Jetson nano for SSH from another computer. Can run graphical applications using VcXsvr on windows. This will be a 'backup' if the HTML client doesnt end up working. Attemped to update Ubuntu to 24.04 (bricked the SD card). Ended up having to reflash jetson Nano. Continued working with Mathias to get Raddar dopller environment working

    


    Mathias - Got Radar SDK to work on windows to test the doppler. Attemped to install Python wheel for Radar SDK on Jetson Nano. Didn't work (incompatible arm7 vs arm8). Shifted to trying to build Radar SDK from source in C for the Jetson Nano.








## Notes 


- Ubuntu Software is giving some compatibility issues. 


- Demonstration due Moday (2/24)
