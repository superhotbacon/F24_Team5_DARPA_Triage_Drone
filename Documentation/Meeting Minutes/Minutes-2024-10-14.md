**Group**  
- Made presentation to introduce the problem with the Georgia Tech Team
- Discussed seperating subsystems into categories for each person to research for meeting next week

## Notes 
- Gave team planned taskes to research over the weekend. Will be giving previous capstones work over to GTRI and connecting them with our capstone repo
  
  
## Group Decisions
- Decided we will most likely be starting from scratch.
- How we are going to split up initial reserach of subsystems.
- Decided to cut out more money for our doppler so that we can have more accurate readings since it will be scanning for both the heart rate and respritory rate


## Planned Tasks
- **Group**  Research subsystems to start working on conceptual design
- **Gabriel Buckner** Research Jetson Nano and learn about its capabilities. 
- **Mathias Hagewood** Reserach doppler radars to figure out which one is best for our team.
- **Caleb Bucher** Reserach microphones for the drone.
- **Reese Gilbert** Research drones and learn the different types and what type and model would work well for our team.
- **Chris Bradley** Look into integration between the Jetson nano and the drones and figure out what to look for in this regard.
