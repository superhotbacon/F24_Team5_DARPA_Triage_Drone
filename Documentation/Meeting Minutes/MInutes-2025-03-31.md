Accomplished

  **Gabriel Buckner** Continue working with Mathias to get the doppler to detect an accurate average heart reate.

  **Mathias Hagewood** Continue working with Gabe to strategize the best method of obtaining an accureate heart rate. 

  **Caleb Bucher** 3D printed an apparatous that will house the jetson nano, dopper, camera, microphone 

  **Reese Gilbert** Configured the TP-Link as an access point. Supported Chris in getting the video to stream from the jetson to the PC

  **Chris Bradley** working to expand the localhost test environment to work peer-peer. Got the video to stream with audio. Made major progress on minimum prototype. 

  **Team** Scheduled a time to demonstrate the minimum functioning prototype. 


## Notes 
- Need to find a heart rate monitor to compare radar data with.
- Maybe need to set limits so doppler doesn't take heart rate of a wall. 
- The range of the data stream might be limited. 
- Need to contact drone club about flying the drone.

  

## Planned Tasks
- **GROUP** Get minimal functioning prototype up and running.
- **GROUP** Get experimental analysis submitted.
