**Group**  
- Completed the Conceptual Design. 
- Met with Dr. Elfouly and went over our conceptual design as well as got insight as to how much payload weight we can expect.

**Individual**

## Notes 
- Need to get working on the detailed design.
- Not sure why Georgia Tech team didn't show up for the meeting. Need to get that figured out.  
  
  
## Group Decisions
- Decided to re-evaluate the drone that was recomended for us. 
- Decided to use LCD display to show both heart rate and respiratory rate.
- Decided that our drone does not need a thermal camera. 


## Planned Tasks
- **Group**
- Detailed Design
- Team Critique 4
- Email Georgia Tech about what drone we are thinking.
